            What is Flutter?
Flutter is an open source framework developed and supported by Google. Frontend and full-stack developers use Flutter to build an applicationâ€™s user interface (UI) for multiple platforms with a single codebase.

When Flutter launched in 2018, it mainly supported mobile app development. Flutter now supports application development on six platforms: iOS, Android, the web, Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
