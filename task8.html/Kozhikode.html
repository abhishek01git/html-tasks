        <h1><u><b>Kozhikode</b></u></h1>
        <p>Kozhikode (pronounced [koːɻikːoːɖɨ̆] ⓘ), also known in English as Calicut, is a city along the Malabar Coast in the state of Kerala in India. It has a corporation limit population of 609,224[7] and a metropolitan population of more than 2 million, making it the second most populous metropolitan area in Kerala and the 19th largest in India.[10] Kozhikode is classified as a Tier 2 city by the Government of India.[11] <br>
            It is the largest city in the region known as the Malabar Coast and was the capital of the British-era Malabar district. In antiquity and the medieval period, Kozhikode was dubbed the City of Spices for its role as the major trading point for Indian spices.[1] It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins). The port at Kozhikode acted as the gateway to medieval South Indian coast for the Chinese, <br> the Persians, the Arabs, and finally the Europeans.[12] According to data compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009 on residences, earnings and investments, Kozhikode was ranked the second-best city in India to live in.[13] In November 2023, Kozhikode became the first Indian city to be included in the list of Creative Cities Network (UCCN) by UNESCO.[14]</p>
